# PwManager

Text-based software that creates 16 digit 102bit entropy passwords and saves them under AES-256 encryption in a json file that's also encrypted with AES-256 and locked with a master key derived from a long decryption key.
Uses: 
1) Create new password for new accounts and save them under double encrypted protection
2) Browse the existing accounts (by website name) and retrieve their data (if you have the KEY or the USB with the KEY)
